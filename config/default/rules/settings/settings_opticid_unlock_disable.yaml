title: Disable OpticID for Unlocking the Device
discussion: |
  OpticID enables the ability to unlock a device with biometric.

  OpticID _MUST_ be disabled for "Unlocking your device" on all devices that are capable of using OpticID.

  The system _MUST_ remain locked until the user establishes access using an authorized identification and authentication method.

  NOTE: OpticID is not an approved biometric authenticator for US Federal Government usage as it has not been verified to meet the strength requirements outlined in NIST SP 800-63.
