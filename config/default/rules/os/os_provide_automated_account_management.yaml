title: Employ Automated Mechanisms for Account Management Functions
discussion: |-
  The organization should employ automated mechanisms to support the management of information system accounts.

  The use of automated mechanisms prevents against human error and provide a faster and more efficient means of relaying time-sensitive information and account management.

  To employ automated mechanisms for account management functions, many operating systems can be integrated with an enterprise-level directory service that meets or exceeds this requirement.

  NOTE: The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
