title: Enforce Access Restrictions
discussion: |-
  The information system _IS_ configured to enforce access restrictions and support auditing of the enforcement actions.

  The inherent configuration of a macOS provides users with the ability to set their own permission settings to control who can view and alter files on the computer.

  NOTE: The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
