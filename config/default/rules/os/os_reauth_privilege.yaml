title: Require users to reauthenticate for privilege escalation
discussion: |-
  Without reauthentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization. When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it is critical the user reauthenticate.

  NOTE: The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
