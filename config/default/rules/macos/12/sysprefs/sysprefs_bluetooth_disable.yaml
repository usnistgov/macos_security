title: "Disable Bluetooth When no Approved Device is Connected"
discussion: |
  The macOS system _MUST_ be configured to disable Bluetooth unless there is an approved device connected.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable Bluetooth, so as to maintain necessary functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.
