title: "Protect Audit Integrity with Cryptographic Mechanisms"
discussion: |
  The information system _IS_ configured to implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools. 
  
  The Apple T2 Security Chip includes a dedicated Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) crypto engine built into the direct memory access (DMA) path between the flash storage and main system memory, which powers line-speed encrypted storage with FileVault and makes internal volume highly efficient.

  NOTE: This will only apply to a Mac that includes a T2 security chip.
