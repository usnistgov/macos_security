title: "Disable Removable Storage Devices"
discussion: |
  Removable media, such as USB connected external hard drives, thumb drives, and optical media, _MUST_ be disabled for users.
  
  Disabling removable storage devices reduces the risks and known vulnerabilities of such devices (e.g., malicious code insertion)
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Some organizations rely on the use of removable media for storing and sharing data. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable external hard drives to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.

  Apple has deprecated the use of link:https://github.com/apple/device-management/blob/eb51fb0cb9626cac4717858556912c257a734ce0/mdm/profiles/com.apple.systemuiserver.yaml#L4-L8[media mount controls], using these controls may not work as expected. Third party software may be required to fulfill the compliance requirements.
