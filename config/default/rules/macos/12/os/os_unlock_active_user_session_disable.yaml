title: "Disable Login to Other User's Active and Locked Sessions"
discussion: |
  The ability to log in to another user's active or locked session _MUST_ be disabled.

  macOS has a privilege that can be granted to any user that will allow that user to unlock active user's sessions. Disabling the admins and/or user's ability to log into another user's active and locked session prevents unauthorized persons from viewing potentially sensitive and/or personal information.
  
  NOTE: Configuring this setting will change the user experience and disable TouchID from unlocking the screensaver. To restore the user experience and allow TouchID to unlock the screensaver, you can run `/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow screenUnlockMode -int 1`. This setting can also be deployed with a configuration profile.
