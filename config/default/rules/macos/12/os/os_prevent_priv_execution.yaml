title: "Prevent Software From Executing at Higher Privilege Levels than Users Executing The Software"
discussion: |
  In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute with elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by the organizations.Some programs and processes are required to operate at a higher privilege level and therefore should be excluded from the organization-defined software list after review.

  The inherent configuration of the macOS does not allow for non-privileged users to be able to execute functions requiring privilege.
