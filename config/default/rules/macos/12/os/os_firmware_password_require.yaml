title: "Enable Firmware Password"
discussion: |
  A firmware password _MUST_ be enabled and set. 

  Single user mode, recovery mode, the Startup Manager, and several other tools are available on macOS by holding the "Option" key down during startup. Setting a firmware password restricts access to these tools.

  To set a firmware passcode use the following command:
  
  [source,bash]
  ----
  /usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd -setpasswd
  ----
  
  NOTE: If firmware password or passcode is forgotten, the only way to reset the forgotten password is through the use of a machine specific binary generated and provided by Apple. Schedule a support call, and provide proof of purchase before the firmware binary will be generated.

  NOTE: Firmware passwords are not supported on Apple Silicon devices. This rule is only applicable to Intel devices.

check: |
  /usr/sbin/firmwarepasswd -check | /usr/bin/grep -c "Password Enabled: Yes"
result: 
  integer: 1
fix: |
   NOTE: See discussion on remediation and how to enable firmware password.
