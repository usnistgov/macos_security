title: "Enable Recovery Lock"
discussion: |
  A recovery lock password _MUST_ be enabled and set. 

  Single user mode, recovery mode, the Startup Manager, and several other tools are available on macOS by holding down specific key combinations during startup. Setting a recovery lock restricts access to these tools.

  NOTE: Recovery lock passwords are not supported on Intel devices. This rule is only applicable to Apple Silicon devices.
