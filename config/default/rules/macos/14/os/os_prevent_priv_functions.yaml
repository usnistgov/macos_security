title: Configure the System to Block Non-Privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions

  Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards and countermeasures.

  The inherent configuration of the macOS does not allow for non-privileged users to be able to execute functions requiring privilege.
