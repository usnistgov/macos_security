title: Password Policy Supplemental
discussion:
  "To comply with Executive Order 14028, \u201CImproving the Nation's Cybersecurity\u201D\
  , OMB M-22-09, \u201CMoving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity\
  \ Principles\u201D, and NIST SP-800-63b, \u201CDigital Identity Guidelines: Authentication\
  \ and Lifecycle Management\u201D federal, military, and intelligence communities\
  \ must adopt the following configuration settings:\n\n  * Password policies must\
  \ not require the use of complexity policies such as upper characters, lower characters,\
  \ or special characters.\n  * Password policies must also not require the use of\
  \ regular rotation.\n\nIn accordance with these requirements, the following rules,\
  \ while they remain on specific benchmarks, have been removed from any of the NIST\
  \ 800-53r5 baselines as recommendations.\n\n  * pwpolicy_alpha_numeric_enforce\n\
  \  * pwpolicy_custom_regex_enforce\n  * pwpolicy_lower_case_character_enforce.yaml\n\
  \  * pwpolicy_max_lifetime_enforce\n  * pwpolicy_minimum_lifetime_enforce\n  * pwpolicy_prevent_dictionary_words\n\
  \  * pwpolicy_simple_sequence_disable\n  * pwpolicy_special_character_enforce\n\
  \  * pwpolicy_upper_case_character_enforce.yaml\n\nIf an organization has requirements\
  \ to implement additional password policies, the remainder of this supplemental\
  \ discusses the following password policy rules:\n\n  * pwpolicy_lower_case_character_enforce\n\
  \  * pwpolicy_upper_case_character_enforce\n  * pwpolicy_account_inactivity_enforce\n\
  \  * pwpolicy_minimum_lifetime_enforce\n\nPassword policies should be enforced as\
  \ much as possible via Configuration Profiles. However, the following policies are\
  \ currently not enforceable via Configuration Profiles, and must therefore be enabled\
  \ using the `pwpolicy` command:\n\n  * Enforcing at least 1 lowercase character\n\
  \  * Enforcing at least 1 uppercase character\n  * Disabling an account after 35\
  \ days of inactivity\n  * Password minimum lifetime\n\nTo set the local policy to\
  \ meet these requirements, save the following XML password policy to a file.\n\n\
  [source,xml]\n----\ninclude::../../includes/pwpolicy.xml[]\n----\n\nRun the following\
  \ command to load the new policy file, substituting the path to the file in place\
  \ of \"$pwpolicy_file\".\n\n[source,bash]\n----\n/usr/bin/pwpolicy setaccountpolicies\
  \ $pwpolicy_file\n----\n\n[NOTE]\n====\nIf directory services is being utilized,\
  \ password policies should come from the domain.\n====\n"
