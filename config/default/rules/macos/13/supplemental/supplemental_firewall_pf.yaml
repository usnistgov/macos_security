title: "Packet Filter (pf) Supplemental"
discussion: |
  The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:
  
  *	os_firewall_default_deny_require

  macOS contains an application layer firewall (ALF) and a packet filter (PF) firewall.
  
    * The ALF can block incoming traffic on a per-application basis and prevent applications from gaining control of network ports, but it cannot be configured to block outgoing traffic.
    ** More information on the ALF can be found here: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201642 
  
    *  The PF firewall can manipulate virtually any packet data and is highly configurable. 
    ** More information on the BF firewall can be found here: https://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/index.html
  
  Below is a script that configures ALF and the PF firewall to meet the requirements defined in NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5). The script will make sure the application layer firewall is enabled, set logging to "detailed", set built-in signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections, and set downloaded signed applications to automatically receive incoming connections. It will then create a custom rule set and copy `com.apple.pfctl.plis` from `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` into the `/Library/LaunchDaemons` folder and name it `800-53.pfctl.plist`. This is done to not conflict with the system's pf ruleset.

  The custom pf rules are created at `/etc/pf.anchors/800_53_pf_anchors`.

  The ruleset will block connections on the following ports:
