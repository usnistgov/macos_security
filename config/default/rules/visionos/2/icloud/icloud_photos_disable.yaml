title: "Disable iCloud Photo Library"
discussion: |

  Apple's iCloud service does not provide an organization with enough control over the storage and access of data and, therefore, automated photo synchronization _MUST_ be controlled by an organization approved service.

  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
