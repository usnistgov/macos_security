title: "Require Passcode for Incoming Airplay Connection Requests"
discussion: |
  When a user is allowed to use AirPlay without a password, it may mistakenly associate the iPhone and iPad with an AirPlay-enabled device other than the one intended (i.e., by choosing the wrong one from the AirPlay list displayed). This creates the potential for someone in control of a mistakenly associated device to obtain DoD sensitive information without authorization. Requiring a password before such an association mitigates this risk. Passwords do not require any administration and are not required to comply with any complexity requirements.
