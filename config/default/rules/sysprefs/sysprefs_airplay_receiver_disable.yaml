title: Disable Airplay Receiver
discussion: |
  Airplay Receiver allows you to send content from another Apple device to be displayed on the screen as it's being played from your other device.

  Support for Airplay Receiver is non-essential and _MUST_ be disabled.

  The information system _MUST_ be configured to provide only essential capabilities.
