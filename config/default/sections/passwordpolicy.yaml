    ====
    The password policy recommendations in the NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.

    NOTE: The settings outlined in this section adhere to the recommendations provided in this document for systems that utilize passwords for local accounts. If systems are integrated with a directory service, local password policies should align with domain password policies to the fullest extent feasible.
