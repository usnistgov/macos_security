== Foreword

The macOS security compliance project is an open source effort to provide a programmatic approach to generating security guidance. This project can be used to create customized security baselines of technical security controls by leveraging a library of atomic actions which are mapped to compliance requirements in existing security guides or used to develop customized guidance. Through the use of a library of atomic actions that enhance security, and mapping them back to existing guides and policies, a single project can support multiple security guides and regulated industry policies while also allowing for documentation and QA to be uniformly managed through a single effort. This approach simplifies, and radically accelerates, the updating of annual security guidance through a unification and standardization of effort.
