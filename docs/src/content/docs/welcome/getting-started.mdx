The macOS Security Compliance Project is developed and maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security).  
**Each branch of the repository contains the rules and resources specific to a particular macOS version.** To work with the project or run its workflows, there are some prerequisites you need to install first.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Git** (optional, only needed if you want to clone the repository instead of downloading files directly from GitHub)  
  [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or use your system's package manager (see note below).
- **Python 3** (required for running the project scripts and generating files)  
  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install via your package manager (see note below).
  - Python modules:
    - `pyyaml`
    - `xlwt`
    - These can be installed using `pip` after Python is set up.  
      For example:  
      ```bash
      pip3 install pyyaml xlwt --user
      ```
- **Ruby** (optional, only needed for working with certain documentation formats)  
  [Download Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or install via your package manager (see note below).
  - Gems:
    - `asciidoctor`
    - `asciidoctor-pdf`
    - `rouge`
    - These can be installed using `gem` or `bundle` after Ruby is set up.

<Aside type="note">
If you are missing any prerequisites, Mac users can install them using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the recommended package manager for macOS.

## Downloading the Repository

You can obtain the project files in one of two ways:

- **Download directly from GitHub:**  
  Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security), select the branch that matches your target OS version (e.g., `sequoia`) using the branch dropdown, then use the "Download ZIP" option.  

   <Aside type="caution">
   <strong>Always pull or checkout the branch that matches your target OS version (e.g., <code>sequoia</code>). Do not use the <code>main</code> branch for workflow or development.</strong>
   </Aside>

  After extracting the ZIP file, change directory to the extracted `macos_security` folder:
  ```bash
  cd macos_security
  ```

  *If you download the ZIP for the correct branch, you can [skip to Working with Project Files](#working-with-project-files).*

**OR**

- **Clone using Git:**  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security.git
  cd macos_security
  ```
  Then, continue below to select the correct branch.

## Selecting the Correct Branch

Before you begin working, select the repository branch that corresponds to the macOS version you intend to work with.

<Aside type="caution">
<strong>Always pull or checkout the branch that matches your target OS version (e.g., <code>sequoia</code>). Do not use the <code>main</code> branch for workflow or development.</strong>
</Aside>

To switch to the appropriate branch:
```bash
git checkout sequoia
```

## Working with Project Files

All the files you will work with are located in the `macos_security` folder. The contents of this folder are specific to the branch you have selected and include the tools and resources required to generate project outputs.

Within this folder, you can:
- Generate baselines
- Produce guidance documentation
- Create DDM and SCAP content
- Generate mappings and compliance scripts
- Make exemptions
- Customize and tailor the output content to your needs
 
For next steps, see the Guides section of this website or visit the project wiki for more detailed walkthroughs.
