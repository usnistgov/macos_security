    This section reviews the configuration and enforcement of password policies in macOS.

    NOTE: The check/fix commands outlined in this section must be run with elevated privileges.

    NOTE: The settings outlined in this section adhere to the recommendations provided in this document for systems that utilize passwords for local accounts. If systems are integrated with a directory service, local password policies should align with domain password policies to the fullest extent feasible.

    [IMPORTANT]
    ====
    Until 800-53 revision 5 is officially published, the password policy recommendations within fall under 800-53 rev4. 800-53 rev4 was released with the guidance published in 800-63 at the time, however, 800-63 has been revised a number of times since then. At this time the recommendation is for organizations to adopt the newer published guidance within 800-63.
