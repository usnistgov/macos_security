# This workflow will set up the oc CLI in your GitHub Action workflow and deploy your application to your OpenShift cluster.
#
# This workflow assumes you already have access to an OpenShift cluster.
# For instructions to get started with OpenShift see https://www.openshift.com/try
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your repository named OPENSHIFT_SERVER_URL with the value of your OpenShift server URL.
# 
# 2. Set up another secret named API_TOKEN with the value of a valid token to authenticate to OpenShift.
#
# 3. Change the values for the PROJECT and APP_NAME environment variables  (below).
#
# For more information on the OpenShift Action, refer to https://github.com/redhat-developer/openshift-actions
