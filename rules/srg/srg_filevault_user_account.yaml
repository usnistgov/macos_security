title: The macOS system must be configured with a dedicated user account to decrypt the hard disk upon startup.
discussion: |
  When "FileVault" and Multifactor Authentication are configured on the operating system, a dedicated user must be configured to ensure that the implemented Multifactor Authentication rules are enforced. If a dedicated user is not configured to decrypt the hard disk upon startup, the system will allow a user to bypass Multifactor Authentication rules during initial startup and first login.
check: |
  Ensure that only one FileVault user is defined:
  
  # sudo fdesetup list
  
  fvuser,85F41F44-22B3-6CB7-85A1-BCC2EA2B887A
  
  If more than one user is defined, this is a finding.
  
  Verify that the defined FileVault user has been disabled:
  
  # sudo dscl . read /Users/<FileVault_User> AuthenticationAuthority | grep "DisabledUser"
  
  AuthenticationAuthority: ;ShadowHash;HASHLIST:<SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2,SRP-RFC5054-4096-SHA512-PBKDF2> ;Kerberosv5;;unlock@LKDC:SHA1.20BABA05A6B1A86A8C57581A8487596640A3E37B;LKDC:SHA1.20CEBE04A5B1D92D8C58189D8487593350D3A40A; ;SecureToken; DisabledUser
  
  If the FileVault user is not disabled, this is a finding.
  
  Verify that password forwarding has been disabled on the system:
  
  # sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow | grep "DisableFDEAutologin"
  
  DisableFDEAutologin = 1;
  
  If "DisableFDEAutologin" is not set to a value of "1", this is a finding.
fix: |
  Create a new user account that will be used to unlock the disk on startup.
  
  Disable the login ability of the newly created user account:
  
  # sudo dscl . append /Users/<FileVault_User> AuthenticationAuthority DisabledUser
  
  Disable FileVaults Auto-login feature:
  
  # sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow DisableFDEAutologin -bool YES
  
  Remove all FileVault login access from each user account defined on the system that is not the designated FileVault user:
  
  # sudo fdesetup remove -user <username>
