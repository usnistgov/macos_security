title: "Configure Audit Failure Notification"
discussion: |
  The audit service should be configured to immediately print messages to the console or email administrator users when an auditing failure occurs. It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without a real-time alert, security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability and system operation may be adversely affected.

  If the argument "-s" is missing, or if "audit_warn" has not been otherwise modified to print errors to the console or send email alerts to the SA and ISSO, this is a finding.
