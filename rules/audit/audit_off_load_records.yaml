title: Off-Load Audit Records
discussion: |
  Audit records should be off-loaded onto a different system or media from the system being audited.

  Information stored in only one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration. Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity.

  To secure audit records by off-loading, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed this requirement.

    check: |
      The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
    fix: |
      This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
