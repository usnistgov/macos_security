title: "Automatically remove or disable temporary user accounts after 72 hours"
discussion: |
  If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts must be set upon account creation.
  
  Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.
  
  If temporary accounts are used, the operating system must be configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a defined time period of 72 hours.
  
  To address access requirements, many operating systems may be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.
  
  If no policy is enforced by a directory service, a password policy can be set with the "pwpolicy" utility. The variable names may vary depending on how the policy was set. 
  
  If there are no temporary accounts defined on the system, this is Not Applicable.

  The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.

  The technology inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
