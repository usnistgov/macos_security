title: The macOS system must automatically remove or disable temporary and emergency
  user accounts after 72 hours.
discussion: 'If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for
  an excessive period, these accounts may be targeted by attackers to gain unauthorized
  access. To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts must
  be set upon account creation.


  Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation procedures
  when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in
  account activation.


  If temporary accounts are used, the operating system must be configured to automatically
  terminate these types of accounts after a DoD-defined time period of 72 hours.


  Emergency administrator accounts are privileged accounts established in response
  to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore,
  emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes.
  If these accounts are automatically disabled, system maintenance during emergencies
  may not be possible, thus adversely affecting system availability.


  Emergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e.,
  local logon accounts used by system administrators when network or normal logon/access
  is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available and are not
  subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator account
  is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.


  To address access requirements, many operating systems may be integrated with enterprise-level
  authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.
