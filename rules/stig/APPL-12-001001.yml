title: The macOS system must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications,
  disabling, and termination events; privileged activities or other system-level access;
  all kernel module load, unload, and restart actions; all program initiations; and
  organizationally defined events for all non-local maintenance and diagnostic sessions.
discussion: 'Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and
  mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate,
  and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible
  for one. Audit records can be generated from various components within the information
  system (e.g., module or policy filter). If events associated with nonlocal administrative
  access or diagnostic sessions are not logged, a major tool for assessing and investigating
  attacks would not be available.


  This requirement addresses auditing-related issues associated with maintenance tools
  used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational information
  systems.


  Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by
  individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the
  internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are
  those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information
  system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection.


  This requirement applies to hardware/software diagnostic test equipment or tools.
  This requirement does not cover hardware/software components that may support information
  system maintenance, yet are a part of the system, for example, the software implementing
  "ping," "ls," "ipconfig," or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring
  port of an Ethernet switch.

check: /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep ^flags /etc/security/audit_control
result: '[''Administrative and Privileged access, including administrative use of
  the command line tools "kextload" and "kextunload" and changes to configuration
  settings are logged by way of the "ad" flag.'', '''', ''If "ad" is not listed in
  the result of the check, this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'To ensure the appropriate flags are enabled for auditing, run the following
  command:


  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sed -i.bak ''/^flags/ s/$/,ad/'' /etc/security/audit_control;
  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/audit -s


  A text editor may also be used to implement the required updates to the "/etc/security/audit_control"
  file.'
