rule_id: MSCP RULE
title: The macOS system must initiate session audits at system startup, using internal
  clocks with time stamps for audit records that meet a minimum granularity of one
  second and can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time
  (GMT), in order to generate audit records containing information to establish what
  type of events occurred, the identity of any individual or process associated with
  the event, including individual identities of group account users, establish where
  the events occurred, source of the event, and outcome of the events including all
  account enabling actions, full-text recording of privileged commands, and information
  about the use of encryption for access wireless access to and from the system.
discussion: 'Without establishing what type of events occurred, when they occurred,
  and by whom it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
  leading up to an outage or attack.


  Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes,
  for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers,
  event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control
  or flow control rules invoked.


  Associating event types with detected events in the operating system audit logs
  provides a means of investigating an attack, recognizing resource utilization or
  capacity thresholds, or identifying an improperly configured operating system.


  '
check: launchctl print-disabled system| grep auditd
result: '[''If the return is not:'', ''"com.apple.auditd" => false"'', '' the audit
  service is disabled, and this is a finding.'']'
fix: 'To enable the audit service, run the following command:


  /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl enable system/com.apple.auditd


  The system may need to be restarted for the update to take effect.'
