title: "Require Passwords Contain a Minimum of One Numeric Character"
discussion: |
  The iOS _MUST_ be configured to require at least one numeric character be used when a password is created.

  This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users. 
check: ""
fix: |
  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
