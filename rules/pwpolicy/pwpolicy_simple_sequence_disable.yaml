title: "Prohibit Repeating, Ascending, and Descending Character Sequences"
discussion: |
  The macOS _MUST_ be configured to prohibit the use of repeating, ascending, and descending character sequences when a password is created.

  This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users.

  NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.

  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
