title: Require Passwords Contain a Minimum of One Special Character
discussion: |
  The macOS _MUST_ be configured to require at least one special character be used when a password is created.

  Special characters are those characters that are not alphanumeric. Examples include: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ *.

  This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users.

  NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.

  NOTE: To comply with Executive Order 14028, “Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity”, OMB M-22-09, “Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles”, and NIST SP-800-63b, “Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management” federal, military, and intelligence communities must adopt the following configuration settings. Password policies must not require use of special characters or regular rotation.

result:
  string: 'true'

  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
