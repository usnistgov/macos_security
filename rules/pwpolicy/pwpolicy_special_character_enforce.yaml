title: "Require Passwords Contain a Minimum of One Special Character"
discussion: |
  The macOS _MUST_ be configured to require at least one special character be used when a password is created.

  Special characters are those characters that are not alphanumeric. Examples include: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ *.
  
  This rule enforces password complexity by requiring users to set passwords that are less vulnerable to malicious users.
  
  NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.

  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
