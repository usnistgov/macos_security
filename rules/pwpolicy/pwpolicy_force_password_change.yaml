title: "Force Password Change at Next Logon"
discussion: |
  The macOS is able to be configured to force users to change their password at next logon.

  Temporary passwords are often used for new users when accounts are created. However, once logged in to the system, users must be immediately prompted to change to a permanent password of their creation.

  To for a user to change their password at next logon, run the following command:
  [source,bash]
  ----
  /usr/bin/pwpolicy -u [USER] -setpolicy "newPasswordRequired=1"
  ----
  NOTE: Replace [USER] with the username that must change the password at next logon

  The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.

  The technology inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
