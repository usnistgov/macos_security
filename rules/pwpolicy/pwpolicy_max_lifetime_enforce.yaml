title: Restrict Maximum Password Lifetime to $ODV Days
discussion: |
  The macOS _MUST_ be configured to enforce a maximum password lifetime limit of at least $ODV days.

  This rule ensures that users are forced to change their passwords frequently enough to prevent malicious users from gaining and maintaining access to the system.

  NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.
  
  NOTE: To comply with Executive Order 14028, “Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity”, OMB M-22-09, “Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles”, and NIST SP-800-63b, “Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management” federal, military, and intelligence communities must adopt the following configuration settings. Password policies must not require use of special characters or regular rotation.

  This is implemented by a Configuration Profile.
