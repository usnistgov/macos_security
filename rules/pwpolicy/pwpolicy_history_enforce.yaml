title: "Prohibit Password Reuse for a Minimum of Five Generations"
discussion: |
  The macOS _MUST_ be configured to enforce a password history of at least five previous passwords when a password is created. 

  This rule ensures that users are  not allowed to re-use a password that was used in any of the five previous password generations. 

  Limiting password reuse protects against malicious users attempting to gain access to the system via brute-force hacking methods.

  NOTE: The guidance for password based authentication in NIST 800-53 (Rev 5) and NIST 800-63B state that complexity rules should be organizationally defined. The values defined are based off of common complexity values. But your organization may define its own password complexity rules.
