title: "Password Policy Supplemental"
discussion: |
  Password policies should be enforced as much as they can with Configuration Profiles. Certain policies are currently not possible and must be enabled using the pwpolicy command:

  * Enforcing at least 1 lowercase character
  * Enforcing at least 1 uppercase character
  * Disabling an account after 35 days of inactivity
  * Password minimum lifetime

  To set local policy to require these requirements. Save the following XML password policy to a file.

  [source,xml]
  ----
  include::../../includes/pwpolicy.xml[]
  ----

  Run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the path to the file in place of "/path/to/file".
  
  [source,bash]
  ----
  /usr/bin/pwpolicy setaccountpolicies /path/to/file
  ----

  [NOTE]
  ====
  If directory services is being utilized, password policies should come from the domain.
