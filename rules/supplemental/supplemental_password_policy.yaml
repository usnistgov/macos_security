title: "Password Policy Supplemental"
discussion: |
  The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:

    * pwpolicy_lower_case_character_enforce
    * pwpolicy_upper_case_character_enforce
    * pwpolicy_account_inactivity_enforce
    * pwpolicy_minimum_lifetime_enforce

  Password policies should be enforced as much as possible via Configuration Profiles. However, the following policies are currently not enforceable via Configuration Profiles, and must therefore be enabled using the `pwpolicy` command:
  
    * Enforcing at least 1 lowercase character
    * Enforcing at least 1 uppercase character
    * Disabling an account after 35 days of inactivity
    * Password minimum lifetime

  To set the local policy to meet these requirements, save the following XML password policy to a file.
  
  [source,xml]
  ----
  include::../../includes/pwpolicy.xml[]
  ----

  Run the following command to load the new policy file, substituting the path to the file in place of "$pwpolicy_file".
  
  [source,bash]
  ----
  /usr/bin/pwpolicy setaccountpolicies $pwpolicy_file
  ----

  [NOTE]
  ====
  If directory services is being utilized, password policies should come from the domain.
