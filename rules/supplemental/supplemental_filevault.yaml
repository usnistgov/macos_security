discussion: |
  The supplemental guidance found in this section is applicable for the following rules:
    * sysprefs_filevault_enforce

  In macOS 11 the internal Apple File System (APFS) data volume can be protected by FileVault. The system volume is always cryptographically protected (T2 and Apple Silicon) and is a read-only volume.
  
  NOTE: FileVault uses an AES-XTS data encryption algorithm to protect full volumes of internal and external storage. Macs with a secure enclave (T2 and Apple Silicon) utilize the hardware security features of the architecture.

  FileVault is described in detail here: link:https://support.apple.com/guide/security/volume-encryption-with-filevault-sec4c6dc1b6e/web[].

  FileVault can be enabled in two ways within the macOS. It can be managed using the fdesetup command or by a Configuration Profile. When enabling FileVault via either of the aforementioned methods, you will be required to enter a username and password, which must be a local Open Directory account with a valid SecureToken password.

  ==== Using the fdesetup Command
  When enabling FileVault via the command line in the Terminal application, you can run the following command.
  [source,bash]
  ----
  /usr/bin/fdesetup enable
  ----
  Running this command will prompt you for a username and password and then enable FileVault and return the personal recovery key. There are a number of management features available when managing FileVault via the command line that are not available when using a configuration profile. More information on these management features is available in the man page for `fdesetup`. 
  
  NOTE: Apple has deprecated `fdesetup` command line tool from recognizing user name and password for security reasons and may remove the ability in future versions of macOS.

  ==== Using a Configuration Profile
  
  When managing FileVault with a configuration profile, you must deploy a profile with the payload type `com.apple.MCX.FileVault2`. When using the Enable key to enable FileVault with a configuration profile, you must include 1 of the following:
  
  [source,xml]
  ----
  <key>Enable</key>
  <string>On</string>
  <key>Defer</key>
  <true />
  ----
  [source,xml]
  ----
  <key>Enable</key>
  <string>On</string>
  <key>UserEntersMissingInfo</key>
  <true/>
  ----

  If using the Defer key it will prompt for the user name and password at logout.

  The `UserEntersMissingInfo` key will only work if installed through manual installation, and it will prompt for the username and password immediately. 

  When using a configuration profile, you can escrow the Recovery key to a Mobile Device Management (MDM) server. Documentation for that can be found on Apple's Developer site: link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/fderecoverykeyescrow[].

  It's recommended that you use a Personal Recovery key instead of an Institutional key as it will generate a specific key for each device. You can find more guidance on choosing a recover key here: link:https://docs.jamf.com/technical-papers/jamf-pro/administering-filevault-macos/10.7.1/Choosing_a_Recovery_Key.html[].

  NOTE: FileVault currently only uses password-based authentication and cannot be done using a smartcard or any other type of multi-factor authentication.
