title: "Protect Against Denial of Service Attacks by Ensuring Rate-Limiting Measures on Network Interfaces"
discussion: |
  The macOS should be configured to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by enforcing rate-limiting measures on network interfaces. 
  
  DoS attacks leave authorized users unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. When this occurs, the organization must operate at degraded capacity; often resulting in an inability to accomplish its mission. 

  To prevent DoS attacks by ensuring rate-limiting measures on network interfaces, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level firewalls that meet or exceed this requirement.
check: |
  The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
fix: |
  This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
