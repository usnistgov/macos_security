title: Obscure Passwords
discussion: |-
  The information system _IS_ configured to obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation by unauthorized individuals.

  The inherent configuration of a macOS uses NSSecureTextField for any text field that receives a password, which automatically obscures text which is entered.

  NOTE: The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
