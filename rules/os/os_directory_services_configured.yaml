title: Integrate System into a Directory Services Infrastructure
discussion: |
  The macOS system _MUST_ be integrated into a directory services infrastructure.

  A directory service infrastructure enables centralized user and rights management, as well as centralized control over computer and user configurations. Integrating the macOS systems used throughout an organization into a directory services infrastructure ensures more administrator oversight and security than allowing distinct user account databases to exist on each separate system.
