title: "Disable Privacy Setup Services During Setup Assistant"
discussion: |
  The prompt for Privacy Setup services during Setup Assistant _MUST_ be disabled.

  Organizations _MUST_ apply organization-wide configuration settings. The macOS Privacy Setup services prompt guides new users through enabling their own specific privacy settings; this is not essential and, therefore, _MUST_ be disabled to prevent against the risk of individuals electing privacy settings with the potential to override organization-wide settings.
