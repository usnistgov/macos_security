id: os_firewall_default_deny_require
title: "The macOS system must employ a deny-all, allow-by-exception firewall policy for allowing connections to other systems."
discussion: |
  Failure to restrict network connectivity only to authorized systems permits inbound connections from malicious systems. It also permits outbound connections that may facilitate exfiltration of data.
  
  If you are using a thrid-party firewall solution, this rule is N/A.  This rule checks for the built in pf packet filter configuration for the default deny rule. 
check: |
  /sbin/pfctl -a '*' -sr &> /dev/null | grep -c "block drop in all"
result:
  integer: 1
fix: |
  NOTE: See the firewall supplemental which includes a script that has an example policy to implement this rule.
