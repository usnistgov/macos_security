title: Disable Call Recording
discussion: |
  The built-in Call Recording _MUST_ be disabled in certain organizations or jurisdictions by legal statutes and/or privacy laws.

  The Call Recording service announces to all users that a cellular phone call is about to be recorded. When recording stops (either manually by the user or by ending the call), the recording is saved to a new note in the Notes app. This functionality may be prohibited by certain organizations or jurisdictions by legal statutes and/or privacy laws.
