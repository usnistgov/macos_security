title: Allow Administrators to Modify Security Settings and System Attributes
discussion: |-
  The information system _IS_ configured to allow administrators to modify security settings and system attributes.

  The macOS is a UNIX 03-compliant operating system, which allows administrators of the system to change security settings and system attributes, including those which are kept within preference panes that are locked for standard users. .

  NOTE: The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
