title: Disable Calendar.app
discussion: |
  The macOS built-in Calendar.app _MUST_ be disabled as this application can establish a connection to non-approved services. This rule is in place to prevent inadvertent data transfers.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Some organizations allow the use of the built-in Calendar.app for organizational communication. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable the macOS built-in Calendar.app to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Apple has deprecated the use of link:https://github.com/apple/device-management/blob/eb51fb0cb9626cac4717858556912c257a734ce0/mdm/profiles/com.apple.applicationaccess.new.yaml#L67-L70[application restriction controls], using these controls may not work as expected. Third party software may be required to fulfill the compliance requirements.
