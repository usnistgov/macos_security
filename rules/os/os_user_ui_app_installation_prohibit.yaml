title: Prohibit User Installation of Software from App Store
discussion: 'Users _MUST_ not be allowed to install software from App Store.


  Allowing regular users to install software, without explicit privileges, presents
  the risk of untested and potentially malicious software being installed on the system.
  Explicit privileges (escalated or administrative privileges) provide the regular
  user with explicit capabilities and control that exceeds the rights of a regular
  user.
