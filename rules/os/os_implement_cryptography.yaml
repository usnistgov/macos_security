title: "Configure the System to Implement Approved Cryptography to Protect Information"
discussion: |
  The information system _MUST_ be configured to implement approved cryptography to protect information. 

  Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules that adhere to the higher standards that have been tested, validated, and approved by the federal government. 

  macOS Catalina is in process of receiving FIPS validation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

  The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement using FIPS Validated Cryptographic Modules.
fix: |
  The technology inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
