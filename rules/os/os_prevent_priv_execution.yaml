title: "Prevent all software from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software"
discussion: |
  In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute with elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by the organizations.Some programs and processes are required to operate at a higher privilege level and therefore should be excluded from the organization-defined software list after review.
check: |
  The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
fix: |
  The technology inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
