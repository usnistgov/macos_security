title: Enforce Blu Ray Read Only
discussion: |
  Blu Ray media _MUST_ be set to read only.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Some organizations rely on the use of removable media for storing and sharing data. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable external hard drives to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.

  ====
  Apple has deprecated the use of link:https://github.com/apple/device-management/blob/eb51fb0cb9626cac4717858556912c257a734ce0/mdm/profiles/com.apple.systemuiserver.yaml#L4-L8[media mount controls], using these controls may not work as expected. Third party software may be required to fulfill the compliance requirements.
