discussion: |
  Disk images _MUST_ be disabled.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Some organizations rely on the use of removable media for storing and sharing data. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable external hard drives to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.

Third party software may be required to fulfill the compliance requirements.
