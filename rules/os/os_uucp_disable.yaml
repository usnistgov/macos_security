title: "Disable Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol Service"
discussion: |
  The system _MUST_ not have the Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol (UUCP) service active.

  UUCP, a set of programs that enable the sending of files between different UNIX systems as well as sending commands to be executed on another system, is not essential and _MUST_ be disabled in order to prevent the unauthorized connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. 

  NOTE: UUCP service is disabled at startup by default macOS.

  /bin/launchctl print-disabled system | /usr/bin/grep -c '"com.apple.uucp" => true'

  /bin/launchctl disable system/com.apple.uucp

  The system may need to be restarted for the update to take effect.
