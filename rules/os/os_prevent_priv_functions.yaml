title: "Configure the System to Block Non-Privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions"
discussion: |

  Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards and countermeasures.

  The inherent configuration of the macOS does not allow for non-privileged users to be able to execute functions requiring privilege.
