title: "Configure the System to Block Non-Privileged Users from Executing Privileged Functions"
discussion: |
  The information system _IS_ configured to block standard users from executing privileged functions. 

  Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards and countermeasures. 
  
  The inherent configuration of the macOS does not allow for non-privileged users to be able to execute functions requiring privilege.
