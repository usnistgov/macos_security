title: Secure Name Address Resolution Service
discussion: |
  The information system requests and performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.

  NOTE: macOS supports encrypted DNS settings with the com.apple.dnsSettings.managed payload, however, the system must be integrated with a DNS server that supports encrypted DNS. link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/dnssettings[]
