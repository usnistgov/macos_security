discussion: |
  The information system requests and performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.

  NOTE: macOS supports encrypted DNS settings with the com.apple.dnsSettings.managed payload, however, the system must be integrated with a DNS server that supports encrypted DNS. link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/dnssettings[]
check: |
  The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
fix: |
  This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
