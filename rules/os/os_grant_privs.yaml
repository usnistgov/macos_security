title: Allow Administrators to Promote Other Users to Administrator Status
discussion: |-

  The macOS is a UNIX 03-compliant operating system which allows administrators of the system to grant privileges to other users.

  NOTE: The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
