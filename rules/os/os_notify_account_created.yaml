title: Configure the System to Notify upon Account Created Actions
discussion: |
  The macOS should be configured to automatically notify system administrators and Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) when new accounts are created.

  Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of reestablishing and maintaining access by creating a new account. Configuring the information system to send a notification when new accounts are created is one method for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process should not only notify when new accounts are created, but also maintain an audit record of accounts made. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.

  To enable notifications and audit logging of accounts created, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed this requirement.

    check: |
      The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
    fix: |
      This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
