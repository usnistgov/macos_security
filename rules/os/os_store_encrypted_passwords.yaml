title: Encrypt Stored Passwords
discussion: |-
  The information system _IS_ configured to encrypt stored passwords.

  Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised.

  NOTE: The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
