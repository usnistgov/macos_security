discussion: |-
  Without mapping the certificate used to authenticate to the user account, the ability to determine the identity of the individual user or group will not be available for forensic analysis.

  NOTE: For directory bound systems, the technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
