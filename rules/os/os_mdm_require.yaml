  MDM grants additional privileges to Mobile Device Management software. User Approved MDM (UAMDM) is required to manage certain security settings on a Mac enrolled outside of Device Enrollment via Apple Business Manager (ABM)/Apple School Manager (ASM). Currently these include:
  * Whitlisting Approved Kernel Extensions
  * Privacy Preferences Policy Control Payload
  * ExtensibleSingleSignOn

  /usr/bin/profiles status -type enrollment | /usr/bin/awk -F': ' 'END{print $2}' | /usr/bin/grep -c "Yes"
result:
  integer: 1
fix: |
  Ensure that system is enrolled via UAMDM.
