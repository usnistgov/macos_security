discussion: |
  Burn support _MUST_ be disabled.

  Some organizations rely on the use of removable media for storing and sharing data. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable external hard drives to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.
