title: "Disable Mail App"
discussion: |
  The macOS built-in Mail.app _MUST_ be disabled. 
  
  The Mail.app contains functionality that can establish connections to Appleâ€™s iCloud, even when security controls to disable iCloud access have been put in place.
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Some organizations allow the use of the built-in Mail.app for organizational communication. Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) may make the risk-based decision not to disable the macOS built-in Mail.app to avoid losing this functionality, but they are advised to first fully weigh the potential risks posed to their organization.
