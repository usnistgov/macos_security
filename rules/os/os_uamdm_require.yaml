  User Approved MDM (UAMDM) grants additional privileges to Mobile Device Management software. UAMDM is required to manage certain security settings on a Mac enrolled outside of Device Enrollment via Apple Business Manager (ABM)/Apple School Manager (ASM). Currently these include:
  * Whitlisting Approved Kernel Extensions
  * Privacy Preferences Policy Control Payload
  * ExtensibleSingleSignOn
