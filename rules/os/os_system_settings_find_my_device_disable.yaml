title: "Disable Find My Device"
discussion: |
  The Find My service _MUST_ be disabled.

  A Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution _MUST_ be used to carry out remote locking and wiping instead of Apple's Find My service.

  Apple's Find My service uses a personal AppleID for authentication. Organizations should rely on MDM solutions, which have much more secure authentication requirements, to perform remote lock and remote wipe.
