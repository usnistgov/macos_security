## Why create this project?

Every year, Apple releases a new version of macOS. Traditionally, security professionals and administrators spend months waiting for the release of an official security baseline. By creating an open source, community-driven method for generating baselines for new macOS versions, we can dramatically reduce the time to release and improve security for everyone.

## Why use a command line based approach when a configuration profile is available?

Some configuration profiles are set once and do not enforce the setting continuously. The only way to reliably validate and enforce certain settings is through a command line based approach, which allows for ongoing compliance checks and remediation.

## Is a Mac management system (MDM) required to implement the controls defined in the YAML?

No, an MDM is not strictly required to implement all controls. However, as macOS evolves, Apple is making it increasingly clear that an MDM server will be necessary to properly secure and manage macOS devices in enterprise environments.
