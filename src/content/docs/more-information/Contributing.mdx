## Contributing

All requests for changes and enhancements are initiated through the [project's GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/issues). To initiate a request, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security/issues/new). The following issue templates exist for creating a new issue:

| Issue Type | Use For |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Feature Request | Describe a new feature or capability to be added to the project |
| Bug Report | Report a problem with an existing feature or capability |
| Question | Ask a question about the project |

The core project team regularly reviews the open issues, prioritizes their handling, and updates the issue statuses and comments as needed.

## Feature Request or Bug Report Process

A good feature request or bug report will help our team assess the issue submitted.

**Great Bug Reports or Feature Requests** tend to have:

1. A quick summary and/or background information
2. Steps to reproduce
   - Be specific!
   - Provide sample code if you can
   - Include all relevant setup
3. What you expected would happen
4. What actually happens (if it's a bug report)
5. Any additional notes

## Contributing Code

The macOS Security Compliance Project uses a typical GitHub fork and pull request [workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). To establish a development environment for contributing to the project, you must do the following:

<Steps>

1. **Comment on the issue**

   Before you start working on a fix, leave a comment in the issue that you're working on the fix so other contributors know it's in progress.

2. **Fork the repository**

   Fork the macOS Security Compliance Project repository to your personal workspace. See the GitHub [guide on forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for details.

3. **Create a feature branch**

   Create a feature branch from the appropriate macOS version branch for making changes. You can [create a branch in your personal repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) directly on GitHub or using a Git client.

4. **Make your modifications**

   Add, remove, and change content in the branch, then stage your changes using `git add` and `git rm` commands.

5. **Commit your changes**

   Include a commit message describing the nature of your changes. You can reference an issue using the hash symbol (e.g., `#34`).

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added new feature X which supports Y addressing issue #34"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

7. **Create a pull request**

   Make sure to [link the pull request to an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) using a keyword.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
Always work from the correct macOS version branch (`sequoia`, `sonoma`, `ventura`, etc.), not `main`.
</Aside>
