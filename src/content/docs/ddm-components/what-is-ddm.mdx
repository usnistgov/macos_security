title: What is DDM?
description: Apple's modern framework for device management.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

export const base = import.meta.env.BASE_URL.endsWith('/') ? import.meta.env.BASE_URL : import.meta.env.BASE_URL + '/';

**Declarative Device Management (DDM)** is Apple's modern approach to managing devices. Unlike traditional MDM where the server sends commands, DDM lets devices manage themselves based on declared configurations.

The mSCP project generates DDM components from your baseline, ready to deploy via your MDM solution.

<Aside type="note">
DDM requires macOS 14 or later and an MDM solution that supports declarative management.

## DDM vs Traditional MDM

| Aspect | Traditional MDM | DDM |
|:-------|:----------------|:----|
| **Control** | Server sends commands to device | Device applies declared configurations |
| **Responsiveness** | Waits for server check-in | Applies changes immediately |
| **Offline behavior** | Limited until reconnected | Enforces policies even offline |
| **Scalability** | Server handles all logic | Logic distributed to devices |

---

## Why DDM Matters

| Benefit | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Faster response** | Devices apply settings immediately without waiting for server |
| **Offline enforcement** | Policies remain active even without network connectivity |
| **Reduced server load** | Devices handle their own compliance evaluation |
| **Better security** | Granular control with Apple's latest security standards |

## What the Project Generates

The project creates DDM declarations in three categories:

| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Activations** | Enable configurations on the device |
| **Configurations** | Settings declarations for various Apple declaration types |
| **Assets** | Data files referenced by configurations (e.g., zipped config files) |
