Exemptions allow you to mark certain rules as "approved exceptions" for your organization. Systems with exemptions are reported as compliant, even if the setting differs from the ruleâ€™s expected result.

> **Note:** The check will still be logged as a finding, but marking it as exempt allows reporting tools to exclude it from non-compliance.

## How Exemptions Work

Exemptions are set in the `org.{baseline}.audit.plist` file, which can be placed in `/Library/Preferences/org.{baseline}.audit.plist` or applied via a custom configuration profile.

---

## Setting an Exemption

<Steps>
1. **Set** `exempt` to `true` for the rule.
2. **Add** an `exempt_reason` describing why the exemption is needed.
</Steps>

**Example: Exempting `auth_smartcard_enforce`**

```sh
sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Add :auth_smartcard_enforce:exempt bool true" /Library/Preferences/org.800-53r5_moderate.audit.plist
sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Add :auth_smartcard_enforce:exempt_reason string 'Reader Issues'" /Library/Preferences/org.800-53r5_moderate.audit.plist

/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print auth_smartcard_enforce" /Library/Preferences/org.800-53r5_moderate.audit.plist
```

**Result:**
```plaintext
Dict {
    finding = true
    exempt = true
    exempt_reason = Reader Issues
}
```

<Aside type="note">
If `org.{baseline}.audit.plist` is not set, the script will default `exempt` to `false`.

*Exemptions help you document and manage approved exceptions in your compliance reporting.*
