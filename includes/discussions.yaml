  discussion: |
    If SSHD is enabled it _MUST_ be configured with the Client Alive Maximum Count set to $ODV.

    This will set the number of client alive messages which may be sent without the SSH server receiving any messages back from the client.  If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, the SSH server will disconnect the client, terminating the session.  The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable.  The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive.

    NOTE: This setting is not intended to manage idle user sessions where there is no input from the client. Its purpose is to monitor for interruptions in network connectivity and force the session to terminate after the connection appears to be broken.

    NOTE: /etc/ssh/sshd_config will be automatically modified to its original state following any update or major upgrade to the operating system.

    NOTE: On macOS 15.2 and higher the SSH configuration can be reset to the macOS default by running /usr/libexec/reset-ssh-configuration.

    Users _MUST_ not be allowed to install software.

    Allowing regular users to install software, without explicit privileges, presents the risk of untested and potentially malicious software being installed on the system. Explicit privileges (escalated or administrative privileges) provide the regular user with explicit capabilities and control that exceeds the rights of a regular user.

    On macOS, restrict users from installing and running software from the /Users/ folder.

    The inherent configuration of the macOS _IS_ in compliance by implementing mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of all applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for such authentication

    macOS contains many open source projects that may use their own cryptographic libraries typically for the purposes of maintaining platform independence. These services are not covered by the Apple FIPS Validation of the CoreCrypto and CoreCrypto Kernel modules.

    Apple is committed to the FIPS validation process and historically has always submitted and validated the cryptographic modules in macOS.

    SSH _MUST_ be configured with an Active Server Alive Maximum Count set to $ODV. Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session or an incomplete login attempt will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

Applications with the listed characteristics have features that can cause the compromise of sensitive DoD data or have features with no known application in the DoD environment.

    Application note: The application allow list, in addition to controlling the installation of applications on the MDM, must control user access/execution of all core and preinstalled applications, or the MDM must provide an alternate method of restricting user access/execution to core and preinstalled applications.
